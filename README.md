This is an Assignment for Programming Foundations II.  Within this assignment, we were to implement the Doubly-LinkedList class.

My implementation is slightly different, in that I have persistent head and tail pointers (i.e. an empty linked list has the head and tail pointing at each other.

In other implementations, the head is the first node, and the tail is the last node.
